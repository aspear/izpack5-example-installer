This code lives on github at:

This project is an example of how to create a working Izpack 5.x installer using maven as the build system.
I make no claims that it is a GOOD example, but it is an example that works.  I would be quite
happy to receive any feedback or ideas on how to improve it.

The project is broken into two pieces. The panels directory contains a maven project that builds
a jar containing the implementation of a custom panel. In this case I just copied the HelloPanel.java that
is included as a part of IzPack and changed the name to prove the concept. The "installer" sub directory
contains the build of the installer itself that packages up the custom panel as a part of the installer.

To build:
mvn clean package
